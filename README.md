# Full Stack Open Learning Journey

Welcome to my repository, where I document my learning journey through [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/). This course is an in-depth guide to modern web development with JavaScript. The main focus is on building single-page applications (SPA) with ReactJS that use REST APIs built with Node.js.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to track my progress and the exercises I have completed throughout the course.

## Course Content

### Frontend Development
- **[React](https://reactjs.org/)**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **[Redux](https://redux.js.org/)**: A predictable state container for JavaScript apps, often used with React.
- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**: A programming language used to develop the logic for user interfaces and server-side applications.

### Backend Development
- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- **[Express](https://expressjs.com/)**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
- **[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)**: A data query and manipulation language for APIs, and a runtime for fulfilling queries with existing data.

### Database Technologies
- **[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)**: A NoSQL database known for its high performance, high availability, and easy scalability.

Each directory in this repository corresponds to a part of the course and within those directories, you will find my exercise solutions.
